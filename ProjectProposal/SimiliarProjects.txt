Here is some games which I've played before that are similiar to my project.

2D platformers:
celeste
cuphead

2D metroidvania:
Hollow Knight
Ori and the will of wisps

2D roguelike:
Dead cells
The binding of Issac

In Hungry Dargon, player will move very similiar to hollow knight, however, the
player is affected by gravity when dashing, and can't do wall jump.
the room generation will be very similiar to the binding of Issac, however, 
hungry dargon will be side view instead of vertical view.
The overall gameplay will be similiar to Hollow Knight and Ori.

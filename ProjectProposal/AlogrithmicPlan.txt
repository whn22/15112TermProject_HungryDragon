stage1: collision. (with terrain, enemies)
(I've done this part)

stage3: Different attack methods of the dragon interact with the enemies.
(determine if the enemy is with in the attack range of the player, if this is 
true, and key pressed == 'c' is true, then enemy lose health.)

stage5: The AI of enemies (and the boss.)
(determine if there is an obstacle between player and enemy, if true, then enemy
stays passive, if false, then enemy wait for 5s, then become active. Active:
double speed, move towards the player)

stage6: Room generation.
(have some types of fixed unchangable terrain, random select a type, then add 
random changable terrains (with reasonable size) to the room, spawn enemys on
the surface of terrains.)
